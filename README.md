WAVS (Web App Vulnerability Scanner) is a tool to scan & test URLs for certain vulnerabilities & security issues by simply inspecting the corresponding client-side website. The overall system would include a virtual server with modules for detecting the different vulnerabilities, along with a proxy server, to direct requests from a browser to the virtual server first while visiting a website. The proxy could warn the user before redirecting to the website if some vulnerabilities are found during the scan done by our virtual server.
